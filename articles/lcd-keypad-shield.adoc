The LCD Keypad shield contains a 1602 LCD connected to pins 4-9 and backlight connected to digital 10. It also has 6 buttons, 5 of which are connected to A0. The sixth is a reset button.

== Arduino Pin Connections

* *LCD RS pin* is connected to D8
* *LCD EN pin* is connected to D9
* *LCD D4 pin* is connected to D4
* *LCD D5 pin* is connected to D5
* *LCD D6 pin* is connected to D6
* *LCD D7 pin* is connected to D7
* *LCD backlight* is connected to D10
* *Buttons* are connected to A0

== Printing Text

After running the code, it may seem like nothing is displayed. This is because of the contrast adjustment trimpot, which is blue with a gold screw and located in the top left corner of the shield.

To adjust this trimpot, get a flat screwdriver and rotate the screw. Note that this is a precision trimpot, so it can take a few turns to reach the proper value.

Once properly adjusted, you should see the words "Hello, world!" displayed on the screen.

== Controlling the Backlight

The LCD's backlight is connected to digital pin 10. It can be controlled like a normal LED with `pinMode` and `digitalWrite`.

Controlling the backlight has many useful applications. For example, the backlight could turn off if there is no user interaction for a long time to implement a power-save mode, similar to a cell phone.

== Using the Buttons

The shield contains six buttons, five of which are connected to A0. Each switch is connected to a resistor with a unique value. This is a resistor ladder, and it saves pins by connecting multiple buttons to one analog input.

When pressed, each button generates a different value on the A0 pin. This is how we can know when a button is pressed, as well as which button it is.

The analog input values for each button are:

* *< 100:* Right
* *> 100, < 200:* Up
* *> 200, < 400:* Down
* *> 400, < 600:* Left
* *> 600, < 800:* Select
* *> 800:* No button pressed

Notice how each button has a range, not a specific value. This is because resistors have a tolerance, so the actual value of a resistor can vary between parts.

We can compare these ranges with the analog input value to interpret each button press.
