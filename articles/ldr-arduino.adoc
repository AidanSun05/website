== LDR Working Principle

LDR stands for Light-Dependent Resistor. As its name suggests, it is a resistor whose resistance changes depending on the amount of light exposed to it. It also has many other names, such as photoresistor and photocell.

An LDR works off the principles of photoconductivity, an optical phenomenon in which a material's conductivity increases when it absorbs light.

When there is more energy in the light that the LDR is exposed to, more current flows through it, so its resistance decreases.

== Code

Since the LDR is an analog device, you can compare it to a predetermined threshold. The code below will turn on an LED if the reading is above 500:

NOTE: This program yields best results in a dark room and with a flashlight to provide a large difference between low and high readings.
