== Driving a Motor with Arduino

A good way to control a motor is to use an H-bridge. This is a type of circuit that allows you to reverse the current flow of the motor, therefore giving you direction control.

An H-bridge contains four switches and a motor at the center, forming an H-like shape. Turning any two of the switches on reverses the motor's current, which can change its direction.

The L293D has two of these H-bridges inside it, allowing you to control up to two DC motors or one stepper motor.

The pins with names containing the same numbers form a single channel in the L293D that can control one motor.

Each pin type has a specific function:

* Enable pins turn the motor on/off and control its speed.
* Input pins control the direction of the motor.
* Output pins connect to the motor to drive it.
* GND pins are ground connection pins.
* Pin 8 is the motor power connection.
* Pin 16 is the IC power connection.

== Controlling L293D

The Enable pins turn their motors on/off. A HIGH state enables the motor; a LOW state disables it. You can also send PWM signals to control motor speed. A duty cycle of 0% stops the motor; a duty cycle of 100% runs the motor at full speed.

The input pin pairs of the H-bridge control the direction of their motor. If input A is high and input B is low, the motor spins one direction. If input A is low and input B is high, the motor spins in the opposite direction. If the inputs' states are the same, the motor stops.

H-Bridge control summary:

|===
|Input (Enable, In A, In B) |Motor Direction/Speed

|0, any, any |Stopped
|1, 1, 1 |Stopped
|1, 1, 0 |Direction 1
|1, 0, 1 |Direction 2
|1, 0, 0 |Stopped
|PWM, any, any |Varied speed
