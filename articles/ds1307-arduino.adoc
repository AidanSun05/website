Date/time and RAM examples are listed in the xref:ds130x-reference.adoc[DS130X Common Reference]. This page covers DS1307-specific features.

== DS1307 Features

The DS1307:

* Consumes little power.
* Stores data in the binary-coded decimal (BCD) format.
* Has 56 bytes of non-volatile static RAM (SRAM). When power is lost, the data in RAM won't be lost.
* Operates using I2C.
* Holds information for seconds, minutes, hours, day of month, day of week, month, and year.
* Automatically corrects the date information at the end of a month and provides leap year correction.
* Can be run in 12 hour (1:00-12:00 with AM/PM flag) or 24 hour mode (0:00-23:00).
* Can have a backup power supply. If the main supply is failing, the chip can detect it and switch over to the backup. It can also keep track of time when the main supply is shut off because of the backup.

== Schematic (Typical Operating Circuit)

image::ds1307-arduino/schematic.png[DS1302 circuit schematic]

Note that the backup supply is a 3V coin cell. This supply will allow the DS1307 to keep track of time when it is turned off.

The I2C communication lines require 10k pullup resistors. This is so they are not floating and can always have a known state.

The SQW output also has a 10k pullup. This is because the pin is open drain and can't directly drive other electronics. Without proper external circuitry, it will also float like the I2C pins.

The DS1307 keeps track of time by reading ticks from an oscillator. This is why a 32.768 kHz oscillator (Y1) is attached to pins 1 and 2.

== Library

This project uses my *DS130X* library. link:/dl/DS130X.zip[Download the library in Zip format]

== Using the SQW Output

In this example, we will use the SQW output on the DS1307. The LED circuit is included in the schematic above.

Note the use of the 10k resistor - this is the pullup resistor required for the SQW output.

The SQW pin is used as a current sink - the LED's anode is connected to 5V and the cathode is connected to R4, then the SQW pin. This is because the output is open-drain, so it can only be used to sink current.

=== Setting the Frequency

To use the SQW pin, we first need to enable the internal oscillator. This done with `setHalt(false);`.

To set the square wave frequency, use `writeRaw` to write to the register `SQW_OUT`. For the data to write, use one of the constants:

* `SQW_HIGH`: Output on
* `SQW_1HZ`: 1 Hz square wave
* `SQW_4KHZ`: 4.096 kHz square wave
* `SQW_8KHZ`: 8.192 kHz square wave
* `SQW_32KHZ`: 32.768 kHz square wave
* `SQW_LOW`: Output off

IMPORTANT: Be sure to use `writeRaw` *(not `write`)* to set the frequency. The constant values are in the raw BCD format.
