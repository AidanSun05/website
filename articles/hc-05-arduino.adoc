== The HC-05 Bluetooth Module

The HC-05 module allows an Arduino to communicate over Bluetooth using the Serial Port Profile (SPP) protocol. This enables it to wirelessly communicate with a Bluetooth Classic-enabled device, such as a computer. Notably, the Arduino code used to communicate through the HC-05 closely resembles the code used to communicate over the standard USB serial port, which will be demonstrated below.

Below is an image of the HC-05 module, with an Arduino Nano for scale:

The HC-05 module has a serial interface, with RX and TX pins. It is a 3.3V logic device, so you need a voltage divider for it to work with a 5V Arduino. (See xref:ultrasonic-sensor-rpi.adoc#_voltage_divider[Using an Ultrasonic Sensor with the Raspberry Pi] for more information.)

* EN pin HIGH: Set to AT Command Mode{empty}footnote:[AT Command Mode allows you to send commands and configuration settings to the module. It is not used in this guide.]
* EN Pin Low: Set to Data Mode (Default)

== Code

[source,cpp]
----
include::../res/HC-05.ino[]

This code uses the `SoftwareSerial` library, which allows serial communication with the HC-05 to be on pins other than 0 and 1. This prevents Bluetooth communication from interfering from regular USB communication with the Arduino, such as uploading code and using the serial monitor.

`SoftwareSerial` has a similar interface to `Serial`: the `available` and `read` functions allow the Arduino to receive data from Bluetooth, while the `println` function allows it to send data over Bluetooth with a newline at the end.

== Controlling Your Arduino

To control your Arduino from your computer, you can use WhaleConnect. For more information on Bluetooth communication in WhaleConnect, refer to its xref:whaleconnect-usage.adoc#_bluetooth[usage documentation].

IMPORTANT: You will need to pair the HC-05 with your computer before communicating with it. It will usually have a name such as *JDY-30, JDY-31, HC-05, or HC-06*. If it requires a passkey, it is usually *0000 or 1234*.

After connecting, you are ready to control your Arduino. Enter 0 to turn off the D13 L LED and enter 1 to turn on the LED.
