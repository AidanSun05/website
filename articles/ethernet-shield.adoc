== The Ethernet Shield

The Ethernet shield provides a standard RJ45 Ethernet jack and micro SD card slot. It has a connection speed of 10/100MB and provides a network stack capable of TCP and UDP.

The shield uses the Ethernet, SPI, and SD libraries, all of which are installed by default in the Arduino IDE. See xref:sd-shield.adoc[SD Shield] for more details about using the SD library.

=== Pin Connections

The Ethernet shield uses SPI:

* Digital 11-13 for SPI
* Digital 10 as the chip select pin for the W5100 Ethernet chip
* Digital 4 as the chip select pin for the SD card slot

This shield gets these SPI connections from the ICSP header on the back of the Arduino, so is compatible with boards that have different SPI pins (example: Arduino Mega).

== SD Card Note

Leaving in an unused SD card can cause your program to crash or hang. Possible solutions:

* Remove the SD card.
* Add these lines in `setup`:

[source,cpp]
----
pinMode(4, OUTPUT);
digitalWrite(4, HIGH);
----

== Setting Up

Save this HTML file as *index.htm* in your SD card:

IMPORTANT: The Arduino SD library only supports 8.3 file names (maximum file name of 8 characters and maximum file extension of 3 characters).

[source,html]
----
include::../res/ethernet-shield/index-sd.html[]
----

Before powering on your Arduino, insert the SD card into the SD slot.

== Code

[source,cpp]
----
include::../res/ethernet-shield/WebServerSD.ino[]
----

=== Explanation

After including the necessary libraries, we declare the MAC and IP addresses (IP for this example is 192.168.0.20).

Next, we initialize the `EthernetServer`. All communication over HTTP is through port 80.

In the `setup` function, there is an SD card init section. Note that both the SD card and Ethernet chip both use SPI, so we need to disable one before using the other. This is why we initialize digital 10 as an output and set it high. Pin 10 is the chip select pin for the Ethernet chip. When we set it high, we are disabling the chip. This way, we can initialize the SD card without interference from the Ethernet chip.

We can then start the web server with `server.begin` and obtain its local IP address in a string with `Ethernet.localIP`.

We then initialize Ethernet with `Ethernet.begin`. We can also use the Ethernet library to check if the shield or cable is connected:

* Use `Ethernet.hardwareStatus` to check if the shield is attached. If the return value is equal to `EthernetNoHardware`, the shield is not attached.
* Use `Ethernet.linkStatus` to check if the cable is connected. If the return value is equal to `LinkOFF`, the cable is not conected.

In the `loop` function, we check if there is a new client (a computer has connected to the IP address). The new client will send a HTTP request, like the one below. All lines end with `\r\n`.

[listing]
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.20
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux i686; rv:17.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/17.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-ZA,en-GB;q=0.8,en-US;q=0.5,en;q=0.3
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: keep-alive

We read each character from the request with `client.read` and print them to the Serial Monitor with `Serial.write`. This is because we are writing the chars as ASCII values and not the chars themselves. For example, `Serial.print(65)` and `Serial.write(65)` would display `65` and `A`, respectively. Using `Serial.write` excludes the need for type conversion from int to char.

If we have reached the end of the request (newline found and current line is blank) we can send the response, which looks like this:

[listing]
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Connection: close

After sending the response, we can send the HTML contents of the page by reading `index.htm` from the SD card and sending its contents to the client. After this, we can break from the `while` loop.

At the end of the `while` loop, we check if the current line in the request is blank (end of the request). If this occurs, the program will send the response on the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the `loop` function, we give the browser time to receive the data, then close the connection.

=== Running the Code

Plug the Arduino's USB port into your computer and the Ethernet cable into your router or direct Internet connection. *This network should be the same as the one your computer is connected to.*

Upload and run the code. When you open the serial monitor, it should tell you the IP address of the server (in this case, 192.168.0.20). The output is below.

[listing]
Ethernet Web Server
Initializing SD card... Done.
Looking for index.htm... Done.
Server is at: 192.168.0.20

In your web browser, go to the IP address displayed. You should see a page like this:

image::ethernet-shield/server.png[Web server page in browser]

== Using CSS

CSS stands for *Cascading Style Sheets*. It is a language commonly used with HTML to edit how a page looks. The file extension for CSS is `.css`.

Save this file as style.css in your SD card:

[source,css]
----
include::../res/ethernet-shield/style.css[]
----

Update `index.htm` with:

[source,html,highlight=5]
----
include::../res/ethernet-shield/index-css.html[]
----

This HTML file uses a new tag: `<link>` (highlighted above), used to include external files (CSS files here).

Arduino code:

[source,cpp]
----
include::../res/ethernet-shield/WebServerCSS.ino[]
----

=== Explanation

In the Arduino code, we have included a separate `if` statement to check if the client requested the CSS file.

Note that in the second line of the response header, we send `Content-Type: text/css` instead of `Content-Type: text/html`. This is because we are sending the stylesheet (CSS file) and not a web page (HTML file). In the response, we must specify what type of file we are sending.

== Running the Code

Follow the same steps as before. However, you should see a different page like this:

image::ethernet-shield/server-css.png[CSS web server page in browser]

== Controlling an LED with AJAX

AJAX stands for *Asynchronous JavaScript And XML*. It is not a programming language, but the use of JavaScript functions to get information from a server (the Arduino). This allows for additional communication between the browser and Arduino.

Connect an LED to the Arduino's Digital 2 pin with a resistor in series.

Then, update `index.htm` on the SD card with the following:

[source,html]
----
include::../res/ethernet-shield/index-ajax-led.html[]
----

The AJAX code is in the JavaScript `sendLed` function. This will send an HTTP request to the Arduino telling if it should turn the LED on or off (determined by the `state` parameter). The request also contains a `nocache` parameter, which will prevent the browser from caching responses from the Arduino (which could result in out-of-date data).

In the `body` tag, we have two buttons. Each has an `onclick` attribute pointing to `sendLed`. However, the parameter given to each button is different; therefore, if you press different buttons, they will send different data.

The Arduino code is as follows:

[source,cpp]
----
include::../res/ethernet-shield/WebServerAjaxLeds.ino[]
----

=== Explanation

This is the first line of the request to change the LED state, sent by the AJAX code:

++++
<pre>
<mark>GET /led&state=off</mark>&nocache=49574.192035966732 HTTP/1.1
</pre>
++++

The only part of this line that we care about is `GET /led&state=off`.

There are several changes from the initial version of the code. First, we have set up a string (`char request[requestLen]`) to capture and store the request for processing.

In the `loop` function, in addition to checking for `index.htm`, we also check if the request contains the word "led". Again, this is part of the request sent by our AJAX code that will be processed by the Arduino.

Inside the `if (contains(request, "state=on"))` statement, we further check if the data contains `state=on` or `state=off`. The value sent will depend on the button pressed in the web page.

=== Running the Code

Follow the same steps as before. However, you should see a page that has a heading: "LED with AJAX". Under this heading, there should be two buttons labeled LED On and LED Off.

When you click the button labeled LED On, the LED should turn on. When you click the button labeled LED Off, the LED should turn off.

== Reading Inputs with XML + AJAX

AJAX can also be used to fetch data from the Arduino. In this example, the Arduino will periodically send the values of some of its inputs to the browser.

NOTE: The Arduino code below uses digital pins 2 and 3 as digital inputs with pullups enabled and A5 as an analog input. You can connect anything to these pins, such as buttons or potentiometers.

Update `index.htm` with the following:

[source,html]
----
include::../res/ethernet-shield/index-ajax-io.html[]
----

Here, `setInterval` is used in JavaScript to call `getInputs` every 250 ms. The browser sends a request to the Arduino similar to before, but it will now wait for a response. The response contains XML data with the values of the digital and analog inputs, which the JavaScript will use to update the contents of the HTML.

Accessing tags in XML is very similar to HTML DOM. However, `document` should be replaced with `this.responseXML`. All the `getElementsBy` methods can be used, and they behave in the same way as HTML DOM.

We declare two arrays: `digitalStates` holds all the `<digital>` tags from the XML. `analogStates` holds all the `<analog>` tags. (A full example of the received XML response is below.) Note that `getElementsByTagName` returns an array.

Next, we get the number of digital and analog pins. This can be done by using the `length` property of the `digitalStates` and `analogStates` arrays.

Finally, we update the HTML DOM with the values from the XML.

The Arduino code is as follows:

[source,cpp]
----
include::../res/ethernet-shield/WebServerAjaxXML.ino[]
----

=== Explanation

We have included another if statement to check if we have received the GET request for the XML file. Note that we send a different header in this statement: the content type is now `text/xml` instead of `text/html`, reflecting the type of data being sent.

There is also a new function called `sendXML`. This function will send all input data in a XML file to the client. The XML data will look like this:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <!--.-->
<inputs>
  <digital>0</digital> <!--.-->
  <digital>0</digital>
  <analog>0</analog> <!--.-->
</inputs>
----
<.> XML declaration: mandatory for all XML data.
<.> Contains information for one digital pin.
<.> Contains information for one analog pin.

The first `<digital>` tag holds the value read by the first digital pin (pin 2) and so on. The `<analog>` tag holds the value read by A5. To send each pin's data, we use `for` loops and iterate through the pins array in `sendXML`.

Note that there is no easy way to get the length of an array in the Arduino language. We will need array length because of our `inputPins` array: it contains the pin numbers we are using as inputs. The array length is just the number of pins that we have put in this array.

To calculate the array length, we use `sizeof`. This is an operator that returns the number of bytes occupied by a variable (in this case, our pins array). By dividing the array size by the size of its data type, we can determine the length.

=== Running the Code

Follow the same steps as in the first example. However, you should see a page that has a heading: "Inputs with AJAX". Under this heading, there should be three rows with the states of all three inputs:

image::ethernet-shield/server-ajax.png[AJAX web server page in browser]

When the state of an input changes, the values should update almost immediately. This is because the function has been configured to run with a delay of 250 ms, or four times per second.
