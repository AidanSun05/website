TIP: It is a good idea to mark the box corresponding to the microcontroller you are using. The boxes are on the underside of the PCB, under the ATmega. For example, if you are using an ATmega1284, mark the box next to the word "ATmega1284" with a permanent marker.

== Setting Up

=== Installing the Arduino Core

Some microcontroller boards (like the ATmega 40 Board) require the installation of an additional software API to work with the Arduino IDE. This is called a _core_. The ATmega 40 Board uses https://github.com/MCUdude/MightyCore[MightyCore] to work with the Arduino environment.

. Open the Arduino IDE, then go to menu:File[Preferences].
. In the text box marked "Additional Boards Manager URLs", enter this URL: `https://mcudude.github.io/MightyCore/package_MCUdude_MightyCore_index.json`. This is the JSON file that will be used to install the core.
. Exit out of the preferences window by clicking OK, then go to menu:Tools[Board > Boards Manager].
. Search for "MightyCore" in the search box, then scroll down until you find it. Click Install to install this core. (You may need to wait for the IDE to download the core's files.)
. Once the installation is complete, exit out of the boards manager and go to the board selection menu under menu:Tools[Board]. You should see the seven microcontrollers under the MightyCore option.

=== Burning the Bootloader

The bootloader is a piece of code that sits inside the microcontroller. It runs when you turn on or reset the board. Its main purpose is to receive code from the computer and write it to flash memory. When you buy a new chip, it usually will be blank, with no bootloader. You will then have to flash the bootloader yourself.

To burn the bootloader, you will need:

* 1x ATmega 40 Board
* 1x Arduino Uno
* 6x Male-female jumper wires

//-

. Connect the boards together. The table below represents the ATmega 40 Board's ICSP header with the board viewed from above, coin cell on the left. Pins listed are the Arduino pins to which the corresponding ICSP pin is connected to.

[%autowidth%noheader]
|===
|D12 |5V
|D13 |D11
|D10 |GND
|===
. In the Arduino IDE, go to the Tools menu and configure the following:
* Board: Arduino Uno
* Port: The COM port of your Arduino Uno (will vary)
* Programmer: Arduino as ISP
. Go to menu:File[Examples > 11.ArduinoISP > ArduinoISP] and upload the sketch to your Arduino Uno. This sketch will turn the Arduino into a AVRISP to flash the bootloader.
. Once the sketch has been uploaded, select the correct microcontroller for your board under menu:Tools[Board]. If the core has been installed successfully, the microcontrollers should appear under "MightyCore".
. Click btn:[Burn Bootloader] under the *Tools* menu. This will flash the ATmega with the bootloader you selected.

== Getting Started

=== Required Materials

* 1x ATmega 40 Board
* 1x 5V FTDI cable

As the ATmega 40 Board contains no onboard USB-to-serial conversion chip, it relies on external circuitry to communicate with your computer. This is provided through an FTDI cable.

IMPORTANT: FTDI cables can come with different voltage levels, such as 3.3V and 5V. Ensure you are using a 5V-compatible cable.

Plug the cable's pin end into the 6-pin FTDI header on the ATmega 40 Board. This is the header next to the DIP switch. When you connect the cable, the black ground wire should be closest to the dot on the PCB:

image::atmega-40-board/ftdi.jpg[FTDI cable on board]

Before uploading programs to the board, make sure that the DIP switch is in the (ON, ON) position. This will enable serial communication over FTDI. If one or both of the channels are in the OFF position, the communication will be disabled and uploading will fail.

Connect the USB end of your cable into your computer. If the power LED does not light, immediately disconnect the cable and check your soldering and connections.

If the power LED does light, you are ready to upload a sketch.

=== Uploading a Sketch

NOTE: There should not be a need to install any drivers for the FTDI cable, as the drivers were automatically installed with the Arduino IDE.

Make sure the correct microcontroller is selected in menu:Tools[Board]. You will not be able to upload a sketch to the board without the correct microcontroller selection.

Upload the Blink sketch, shown below, to your board. The "L" LED should start blinking.

[source,cpp]
----
include::../res/code/atmega-40-board/Blink.ino[]
----

=== PWM on D13 LED

Digital pin 13 is PWM-capable on all microcontrollers. This means that `analogWrite` can be used to change the brightness of the LED. Upload the sketch below, and the LED should be increasing and decreasing in brightness:

[source,cpp]
----
include::../res/code/atmega-40-board/Fade.ino[]
----

=== Shift Register

The ATmega 40 Board has an on-board 74HC595 shift register. The connections to the microcontroller are below:

* Data connects to D18
* Latch connects to D19
* Clock connects to D20

An example of using a shift register with the Arduino is available xref:74hc595-arduino.adoc[here]. You can modify the digital pins used in the example to match those listed above.

NOTE: The ATmega 40 Board contains built-in resistors for the shift register. Therefore, external resistors don't need to be used when connecting LEDs to the shift register outputs.

=== Servos

To test a servo, you will need these parts:

* 1x ATmega 40 Board
* 1x 9g standard servo

The ATmega 40 Board has two digital pins next to power pins: D14 and D15. This means that you can directly plug a servo into these pins. In this example, we will be using D15.

NOTE: The standard Servo library will not work with ATmega 40 microcontrollers since they handle timers differently than the microcontrollers used in typical Arduino boards.

Fortunately, MightyCore includes an adapted version of the Servo library which does work with these microcontrollers and is accessible with `#include <Servo.h>`. This means that from the code, there will be no difference from controlling a servo using the built-in Servo library.

When you upload and run the code below, the servo should start moving back and forth:

[source,cpp]
----
include::../res/code/atmega-40-board/Sweep.ino[]
----

=== On-board RTC

IMPORTANT: The RTC cannot be used with the ATmega8535. This is due to the small memory size of the microcontroller.

The ATmega 40 Board contains an on-board DS1307 RTC. This RTC uses I2C to communicate. Using the on-board RTC will be exactly the same as using an external one with Arduino.

I have written a separate tutorial on using a DS1307 with Arduino. xref:ds1307-arduino.adoc[View it here.]

NOTE: The RTC requires my DS130X library. link:/dl/DS130X.zip[Download the library in Zip format] | xref:ds130x-reference.adoc[DS130X Documentation]

Once you have read the tutorial and installed this library, go to menu:File[Examples > DS130X > DS1307 > DateAndTime > PrintDateTime].

After uploading and running the code, open the serial monitor. There should be a steady stream of timestamps read from the RTC:

=== Reading Coin Cell Voltage

The ATmega 40 Board has a 2&#215;3 header containing only power pins. This header is located to the left of the coin cell.

The top row (labeled BAT) is connected to the coin cell's output. This means that you can use the pins to read the voltage of the coin cell without having to take it out.

TIP: Both pins in the BAT row are connected. This means that you can use either pin to read the coin cell.

To read the coin cell with the ATmega 40 Board, connect one of the BAT pins to analog input A0. The code below reads the analog value on A0, then converts it into a voltage to determine the state of the coin cell.

[source,cpp]
----
include::../res/code/atmega-40-board/TestCoinCell.ino[]
----

After uploading and running the sketch, open the serial monitor. It will display the voltage read from the coin cell. If the coin cell has a voltage above 2V, it will print 'OK'. Otherwise, it will tell you to replace it. This is a sample output:

== Issues with Arduino Compatibility

Below are some limitations of the compatibility of the ATmega 40 Board with the Arduino environment, including software and hardware issues.

=== Software Issues

* No support for Pin Change Interrupts (PCINTs). This means that libraries that use PCINTs are not compatible on these microcontrollers (example. SoftwareSerial).
* The standard Servo library will not work with these microcontrollers. (Note that this problem is solved through MightyCore, which provides an adapted library with the same `#include <Servo.h>`.)
* When porting code from a different board, the memory size of the microcontroller may be different. If the ATmega 40 microcontroller has less memory than the original board, porting and uploading may fail. See the Technical Details above for a comparison of memory sizes for these microcontrollers.

=== Hardware Issues

* The I2C pins on ATmega 40 microcontrollers are different than on the standard Arduino Uno. This means that any shields that use I2C are not compatible on the ATmega 40 Board.
* The SPI pins on ATmega 40 microcontrollers are different than on the standard Arduino Uno. This means that any shields that use SPI must communicate via the ICSP header, which is standard across all Arduino boards.

An easy way to tell if a shield uses ICSP is by looking at its underside - if it has a black 2&#215;3 header on the back and it plugs into the ICSP header, the shield uses ICSP and is compatible.

image::atmega-40-board/icsp.jpg[ICSP header on shield and ATmega 40 Board]

=== Serial Communication Issue

On ATmega 40 microcontrollers, TX and RX are now on digital pins 9 and 8, respectively. This means that using these pins for general I/O use could disrupt serial communications, but on a standard Arduino, this will pose no issue.

The workaround for this issue is the DIP switch on the board: when set to (ON, ON), digital pins 8 and 9 will have a connection to the FTDI header. This allows serial communication to occur, but these pins cannot be used for general I/O.

When set to (OFF, OFF), the pins will no longer be connected to the FTDI header. This will essentially turn the FTDI cable into a 'power-only' type cable - the device receives power, but the data lines for communication are not connected. This will free up pins 8 and 9 so you can use them for I/O.

IMPORTANT: If the DIP switch is in the (OFF, OFF) position, uploading sketches and serial communication will fail.
