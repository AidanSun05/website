== The ADS1115

The ADS1115 is an ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter). ADCs convert analog signals (like sine waves) into digital signals through communication protocol like SPI or I2C. They are used to give analog inputs to a device incapable of measuring analog signals by itself, such as Raspberry Pis.

Below are some specifications for the ADS1115:

* Operating voltage: 2.0 V-5.5 V
* Current consumption: 150 µA in continuous mode
* Communication protocol: I2C
* Programmable data rate: 8-860 SPS (Samples Per Second)
* Precision: 16 bits
* Number of channels (analog inputs): 4
* Programmable comparator
* Internal oscillator
* Internal low-drift reference voltage
* Four single-ended or two differential inputs
* Programmable gain

|Pin |Description

|VDD |ADC power in connection
|GND |ADC ground connection
|SCL |I2C pin (serial clock)
|SDA |I2C pin (serial data)
|ADDR |Address selection pin
|ALRT |Alert/Ready signal connection
|A0 |Analog input 0
|A1 |Analog input 1
|A2 |Analog input 2
|A3 |Analog input 3
|===

== ADS1115 Addressing

There are four addresses available. They are set by connecting the ADDR pin to either VDD, GND, SDA, or SCL.

|===
|Connect ADDR to |Address

|GND |0x48 (0b1001000)
|VDD |0x49 (0b1001001)
|SDA |0x4A (0b1001010)
|SCL |0x4B (0b1001011)
|===

NOTE: The default address, when ADDR is not connected, is 0x48.

== ADS1115 Resolution

The output of the ADS1115 is a signed integer (positive or negative). This means that although the precision of the ADC is 16 bits, only 15 bits are used for the value of voltage measurements. One of the bits determines the sign of the value. So, there are 32,768 possible output values (0 to 32,767, or stem:[000000000000000_2] to stem:[111111111111111_2] binary).

== ADS1115 Full Scale and Value of a Bit

The value of a bit is determined by the Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA) setting. This setting establishes the full scale. In the default mode, the setting is ±6.144 V where 32,767 represents an input value of 6.144 V. Dividing 6.144 V by 32,767 yields a scale factor of 0.1875 mV per bit. You can also change the PGA setting to have a smaller full scale of ±2.048 V. That provides a more precise resolution of 0.0635 mV per bit.

IMPORTANT: The maximum analog input voltage cannot exceed the voltage at VDD + 0.3 V. For example, if VDD is 3.3 V, the analog inputs cannot exceed 3.6 V. If the input does exceed 3.6 V, the chip on the ADS1115 could be damaged.

== Schematic

image::ads1115-rpi/schematic.png[ADS1115 schematic]

NOTE: It is a good idea to tie any unused inputs to ground to avoid "floating" inputs, where an input pin gives erratic readings, due to the fact that it is not connected to anything.

== Enabling I2C

Since the ADS1115 communicates over I2C, your Raspberry Pi needs I2C to be enabled. Follow the steps below if you haven't already enabled I2C:

. Go to the Raspberry Pi configuration tool with `sudo raspi-config`.
. Use the arrow and kbd:[Enter] keys to go to btn:[Interfacing Options].
. Go to btn:[I2C].
. When the "Would you like the ARM I2C interface to be enabled?" message appears, select btn:[Yes].

== Python Library

Below is a simple Python 3 library to use the ADS1115. Save it on your Raspberry Pi as `ads1115.py`:

[source,python]
----
include::../res/ads1115-rpi/ads1115.py[]
----

NOTE: To learn more about the specific I2C values and how they should be sent to the ADS1115, go to its datasheet.

== Reading Channels

There should be an output with four columns, A0 reading on the left to A3 reading on the right. Rotate the trimpot connected to A0 to make the first value change.

=== Explanation

After importing the library, we create an ADS1115 instance. The `ADS1115` constructor also accepts the following keyword arguments:

* `device_address`: ADC address (default is 0x48)
* `gain`: Gain value, possible values:
** `GAIN_2_3`, gain of ± 6.144 V
** `GAIN_1` - gain of ± 4.096 V (default)
** `GAIN_2` - gain of ± 2.048 V
** `GAIN_4` - gain of ± 1.024 V
** `GAIN_8` - gain of ± 0.512 V
** `GAIN_16` - gain of ± 0.256 V
* `sps`: Data rate in samples per second (SPS), possible values:
** `SPS_8` - 8 SPS
** `SPS_16` - 16 SPS
** `SPS_32` - 32 SPS
** `SPS_64` - 64 SPS
** `SPS_128` - 128 SPS (default)
** `SPS_250` - 250 SPS
** `SPS_475` - 475 SPS
** `SPS_860` - 860 SPS

For example, to initialize the ADS1115 with address 0x49, gain of ± 2.048 V, and data rate of 250 SPS, you would use:

[source,python]
----
a = ADS1115(device_address=0x49, gain=GAIN_2, sps=SPS_250)
----

In the infinite loop, we read from each of the four channels with `read_adc`. This method reads from a single ADC channel and takes the following parameter:

. `ch`: The channel to read from (0 reads from A0, 1 reads from A1, etc.)

If a `KeyboardInterrupt` is caught, the program prints a message and exits.

== Reading Differential Inputs

The following code reads the differential input between A0 and A1:

The output should have one column. Rotate both trimpots to see how the value changes.

=== Explanation

This ADS1115 library supports reading differential inputs with `read_adc_differential`. This method reads from two ADC channels and returns the difference. It accepts one parameter:

. `ch`: Which two channels to read

Possible values:

* `DIFF_0_1` returns channel 0 minus channel 1
* `DIFF_0_3` returns channel 0 minus channel 3
* `DIFF_1_3` returns channel 1 minus channel 3
* `DIFF_2_3` returns channel 2 minus channel 3

In the example code, we use `DIFF_0_1`, which makes the method return A0 reading minus A1 reading. The loop and exception handling parts are the same as the first example.

== Using the Comparator

=== About the ADS1115 Comparator

The ADS1115 has a built-in comparator. This comparator has two modes: traditional and window.

* In _traditional mode_, the ADS1115 activates the ALRT pin if the input of a channel goes above a specified high threshold. The ALRT pin gets deactivated when the reading drops below a specified low threshold.
* In _window mode_, the ALRT pin activates when the reading is outside the range of the two thresholds. The ALRT pin gets deactivated when the reading is in the range of the two thresholds.

=== Code

[source,python,highlight=7..9]
----
include::../res/ads1115-rpi/read_comparator.py[]
----

=== Explanation

To read the ADS1115 comparator, use `read_adc_comparator`. This method accepts the following parameters:

. `ch`: Channel to read from
. `low_thresh`: Low threshold
. `high_thresh`: High threshold
. `active_low`: State of the ALRT pin: active low if True, active high if False (optional, default is True)
. `traditional`: Mode of the comparator: traditional if True, window if False (optional, default is True)
. `latching`: If the comparator is latching: latching if True, not latching if False (optional, default is False)
. `num_readings`: Number of readings the ADC reads before changing the state of the ALRT pin (optional, default is 1)

In the example code, `low_thresh` is set to 2000 and `high_thresh` is set to 10000. All optional parameters are left alone.

This example code by default uses the comparator in traditional mode. Play the video below to see how the LED should change in traditional mode.

video::{videosdir}/ads1115-rpi/comparator-traditional.mp4[]

To use window mode, uncomment line 8 and comment line 7. Run the code again, and you should see the LED turn on when it is inside the 2000-10000 range:

video::{videosdir}/ads1115-rpi/comparator-window.mp4[]

To set the ALRT pin to active high, uncomment the third `read_adc_comparator` line (line 9) and comment the other two.

Active high can be used with both comparator modes. Combine `traditional=False` with `active_low=False` to have the pin active high in window mode.

If you run the code again, you should see that the LED's state is inverted:
