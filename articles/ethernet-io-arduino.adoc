== Overview

This project uses a web server page to control the Arduino's I/O ports remotely. See [Ethernet Shield](/articles/ethernet-shield/) for more details on using the Ethernet shield and its SD card slot with Arduino.

WARNING: An Arduino Uno may not have enough memory for this program. You can use any board with sufficient memory, such as a Mega.

== HTML File

Save this HTML file as *index.htm* in your SD card:

[source,html]
----
include::../res/code/ethernet-io-arduino/index.html[]
----

This HTML page is similar to the last example in the "Ethernet Shield" article. There are not many changes to the HTML/JS code. This is because we used many loops to iterate through the pins, so the request handling code can be left alone. However, there are more tags that show the input states, since we have more inputs. We have also used `<div>` tags, which are used to style a group of elements.

We have also used internal CSS in the `<style>` tag. The `float: left;` means that the element should go as far left as possible in its container and `margin-left: 25px;` means that there should be a 25px wide margin to the left of the element.

== Arduino Code

[source,cpp]

== Running the Code

Follow the same steps as in "Ethernet Shield". However, you should see a different page:

image::ethernet-io-arduino/server.png[I/O web server page in browser]

This page contains three columns: one for digital inputs, one for analog inputs, and one for digital outputs.

The first two columns contain the states of digital and analog inputs, respectively.

The last column allows you to control the three digital outputs.
