== Overview

This project is a simple timer created with an Arduino. It uses the following libraries:

* *Keypad* by Mark Stanley and Alexander Brevig; sets up and polls the different keypad pins. To install, go to the Arduino IDE's Library Manager and search for "keypad". Click on the library, then click btn:[Install].
* *SevenSegmentShield*; provides functions for interfacing with the Gravitech seven-segment shield. For a download and more information, follow xref:7-segment-shield.adoc[this guide].

This project uses the https://www.gravitech.us/7segmentshield.html[Gravitech seven-segment shield].
