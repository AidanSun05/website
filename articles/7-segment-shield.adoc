== The Seven-Segment Shield

The shield is available https://www.gravitech.us/7segmentshield.html[here]. It has the following onboard devices:

* Four bright green 7-segment digits
* I2C 7-segment driver (NXP SAA1064)
* 128K I2C EEPROM (24LC128)
* I2C Digital thermometer (TMP75)
* 10mm RGB LED (with PWM)

NOTE: The shield uses Arduino pins D3, D5, D6 (for the LED), A4, and A5 (for I2C), so they cannot be used for anything else.

== Library

This project uses my *SevenSegmentShield* library. link:/dl/SevenSegmentShield.zip[Download the library in Zip format]

All example code is under menu:File[Examples > SevenSegmentShield].

== Displaying Digits and Letters

The menu:Display[CycleDigits] example displays the digits 0-9 on each segment.

[source,cpp]
----
include::../res/lib/SevenSegmentShield/examples/Display/CycleDigits/CycleDigits.ino[]
----

video::{videosdir}/7-segment-shield/cycle.mp4[]

The menu:Display[DisplayChars] example directly writes to the segments, displaying "-AbC".

[source,cpp]
----
include::../res/lib/SevenSegmentShield/examples/Display/DisplayChars/DisplayChars.ino[]
----

=== Initializing the Display

`Wire.begin` must be called before using any of the shield's I2C devices to initialize the communication bus.

The `begin` method of the `Display` class sets the default brightness for the LEDs. (See "Cycling Brightness")

=== Displaying on a Single Digit

Both methods below take the following parameter:

`digit`: The digit to write to, from 1 (rightmost on the shield) to 4 (leftmost)

`writeDigit`: Displays a digit. Takes the following parameters:

. `digit`
. `value`: The numeric value to show on the digit (0-9)
. `decimalPoint`: If the digit's decimal point is shown (`true` to show, `false` to hide)

`writeDigitData`: Controls the individual segments on a digit.

. `digit`
. `value`: 1-byte integer containing the segments to display

.Segment Values
[%collapsible]
====
Segment values may be added together to display them together:

=== Clearing the Display

`clear`: Turns off all segments on the display. Takes no parameters.

== Displaying Integers

Integers can also be displayed on the shield. An example is at menu:Display[DisplayNum].

[source,cpp]
----
include::../res/lib/SevenSegmentShield/examples/Display/DisplayNum/DisplayNum.ino[]
----

The code above randomly generates integers and displays them with the function below:

`displayInt`: Shows an integer on the entire display.

. `number`: Number to show (-999 to 9999)

== Cycling Brightness

The brightness of the display can be adjusted by changing the amount of current the LEDs receive. An example is at menu:Display[CycleBrightness].

[source,cpp]
----
include::../res/lib/SevenSegmentShield/examples/Display/CycleBrightness/CycleBrightness.ino[]
----

The code loops through each possible current value, passing each to the function:

`writeBrightness`: Sets the brightness of the seven-segment display. The default current is 12 mA.

. `brightness`: Current value to determine brightness. Possible values are:
* BRIGHTNESS_3MA (3 mA current)
* BRIGHTNESS_6MA (6 mA current)
* BRIGHTNESS_9MA (9 mA current)
* BRIGHTNESS_12MA (12 mA current)
* BRIGHTNESS_18MA (18 mA current)
* BRIGHTNESS_21MA (21 mA current)

== Using the EEPROM Chip

The 24LC128 chip on the shield can hold 128 kB of data. The menu:EEPROM[ReadWrite] example demonstrates performing I/O on the addresses of the EEPROM.

[source,cpp]
----
include::../res/lib/SevenSegmentShield/examples/EEPROM/ReadWrite/ReadWrite.ino[]

EEPROM address 19 holds 19

=== Reading and Writing Memory

The methods below are part of the `MemoryChip` class, which represents the onboard 24LC128. They share the following parameter:

`address`: The address to read or write from

`readByte`: Returns the byte at the specified memory address.

. `address`

`writeByte`: Writes the given byte to the specified memory address.

. `address`
. `data`: Byte to write

IMPORTANT: After writing to the EEPROM, insert a short delay (such as 5 ms in the example) to prevent the loss of communication data.

== Controlling the LED

The shield's RGB LED is connected to three PWM pins on the Arduino. The menu:LED[CycleColors] example uses PWM to display different colors.

[source,cpp]
----
include::../res/lib/SevenSegmentShield/examples/LED/CycleColors/CycleColors.ino[]
----

=== Hex and RGB Colors

The example above defines 48 hex colors. Each color is an integer with 8 bits of red (leftmost bits), green, and blue (rightmost bits) values.

`displayHexColor`: Displays a color on the LED given in hexadecimal format.

. `hh`: Color

`displayRGBColor`: Displays a color on the LED given with individual red, green, and blue components.

. `r`: 8-bit red value
. `g`: 8-bit green value
. `b`: 8-bit blue value

`turnOff`: Turns the LED off. Takes no parameters.

== Reading from the TMP75

The menu:TMP75[Thermometer] example uses the shield to create a thermometer. The temperature is displayed on the segments, and the LED changes color accordingly.

[source,cpp]
----
include::../res/lib/SevenSegmentShield/examples/TMP75/Thermometer/Thermometer.ino[]

All TMP75 functions are contained inside a class called `TMP75`.

=== Initializing the TMP75

`begin`: Initializes the TMP75 and configures it to 12-bit resolution.

=== Reading the Temperature

`read`: Returns the temperature read by the TMP75 in degrees Celsius.
