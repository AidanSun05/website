Date/time and RAM examples are listed in the [DS130X Common Reference](/articles/ds130x-reference). This page covers DS1302-specific features.

## DS1302 Features

The DS1302:

- Consumes little power.
- Stores data in the binary-coded decimal (BCD) format.
- Has 31 bytes of non-volatile static RAM (SRAM). When power is lost, the data in RAM won't be lost.
- Operates using a three-wire serial interface.
- Holds information for seconds, minutes, hours, day of month, day of week, month, and year.
- Automatically corrects the date information at the end of a month and provides leap year correction.
- Can be run in 12 hour (1:00-12:00 with AM/PM flag) or 24 hour mode (0:00-23:00).
- Can trickle-charge its battery by outputting voltage from its V~BAT~ pin.

## Schematic (Typical Operating Circuit)

![DS1302 schematic](@img/ds1302-arduino/schematic.png)

Note that the backup supply is a 3V coin cell. This supply will allow the DS1302 to keep track of time when it is turned off.

The DS1302 keeps track of time by reading ticks from an oscillator. This is why a 32.768 kHz oscillator (Y1) is attached to pins 1 and 2.

## Library

This project uses my **DS130X** library. [Download the library in Zip format](/zipped/DS130X.zip)

## Using the TCR (Trickle Charge Register)

Trickle charging means to charge a battery at the same rate as its discharge rate, so it remains at its current level. The DS1302 charges its battery by outputting voltage from its V~CC1~ pin.

The example code is at **File > Examples > DS130X > DS1302 > Other > SetTCR**. It does not output anything to the serial monitor.

<Alert type="important">
  If you have a non-rechargeable battery (or if you don't know if it's rechargeable), take it out before running this example. Attempting to charge a non-rechargeable battery can cause it to catch fire or explode.

  You can use a multimeter to measure the voltage between V~CC1~ and GND to make sure this function works.

### DS1302 TCR Output Voltage/Current

The DS1302 outputs the same amount of voltage present on V~CC2~, the main power supply. In our circuit, the DS1302's main power supply (the Arduino's 5V pin) is 5V, so the TCR will also output 5V.

The DS1302's TCR has internal resistors and diodes. Selecting how many of these are activated will change the output current.

You can select any combination of resistors and diodes from below:

- 1 or 2 diodes
- 2k, 4k, or 8k resistor

The formula for calculating the output current from the diodes/resistors is:

$$
I_{max} = \frac{5-D}{R_1}
$$

- $I_{max}$: Output current (A)
- $D$: Diode drop, e.g., voltage drop across a diode (typically 0.7 V); multiply this by the number of diodes you selected
- $R_1$: Resistor value you selected (&ohm;)

For example, the output current of having 1 diode and the 2k resistor selected would be:

$$
I_{max} = \frac{5-0.7}{2000} = 0.00215 \mathrm{A} \approx 2.2 \mathrm{mA}
$$

### Configuring the TCR

The DS1302 powers up with the TCR disabled. To enable the TCR, use `writeRaw` **(not `write`)** to write to the register `TCR_SET`. For the data to write, use one of these six constants:

- `TCR_DISABLE`: TCR is disabled
- `TCR_1D_2R`: 1 diode and 2 k&ohm; resistance
- `TCR_1D_4R`: 1 diode and 4 k&ohm; resistance
- `TCR_1D_8R`: 1 diode and 8 k&ohm; resistance
- `TCR_2D_2R`: 2 diodes and 2 k&ohm; resistance
- `TCR_2D_4R`: 2 diodes and 4 k&ohm; resistance
- `TCR_2D_8R`: 2 diodes and 8 k&ohm; resistance
- `TCR_INITIAL`: Initial power-on state (also disabled)

For example, to set the TCR to have 1 diode and a 2k resistor to have a 2.2mA current (like described above), use:

```cpp
rtc.writeRaw(TCR_SET, TCR_1D_2R);
```

<Alert>
  To get the current TCR setting, read from the `TCR_GET` register. `readRaw` is preferred since it returns the raw BCD data, like how `writeRaw` writes raw data.
</Alert>

In the code, The Arduino will disable the RTC's write protect, then write to the `TCR_SET` register with data `TCR_1D_2R` (1 diode, 2k resistor).
