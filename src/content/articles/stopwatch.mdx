## Overview

This page was updated in 2020 to use the SevenSegmentShield library. For a download and more information, follow [this guide](/articles/7-segment-shield).

This code uses the [Gravitech seven-segment shield](https://www.gravitech.us/7segmentshield.html).

## Code

This is a simple program that counts up every second and displays the counter on the segments, similar to a stopwatch.
