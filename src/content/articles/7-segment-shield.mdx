## The Seven-Segment Shield

The shield is available [here](https://www.gravitech.us/7segmentshield.html). It has the following onboard devices:

- Four bright green 7-segment digits
- I2C 7-segment driver (NXP SAA1064)
- 128K I2C EEPROM (24LC128)
- I2C Digital thermometer (TMP75)
- 10mm RGB LED (with PWM)

<Alert>
  The shield uses Arduino pins D3, D5, D6 (for the LED), A4, and A5 (for I2C), so they cannot be used for anything else.
</Alert>

## Library

This project uses my **SevenSegmentShield** library. [Download the library in Zip format](/zipped/SevenSegmentShield.zip)

All example code is under **File > Examples > SevenSegmentShield**.

## Displaying Digits and Letters

The **Display > CycleDigits** example displays the digits 0-9 on each segment.

<TabBar id="display" titles={["Code", "Video"]} client:load>
  <TabPane id="display" index={0} client:load>
    <CodeFile src="downloads/SevenSegmentShield/examples/Display/CycleDigits/CycleDigits.ino" />
  </TabPane>
  <TabPane id="display" index={1} client:load>
    <VideoPlayer src="7-segment-shield/cycle.mp4" />
  </TabPane>
</TabBar>

The **Display > DisplayChars** example directly writes to the segments, displaying "-AbC".

<CodeFile src="downloads/SevenSegmentShield/examples/Display/DisplayChars/DisplayChars.ino" />

### Initializing the Display

`Wire.begin` must be called before using any of the shield's I2C devices to intialize the communication bus.

The `begin` method of the `Display` class sets the default brightness for the LEDs. (See "Cycling Brightness")

### Displaying on a Single Digit

Both methods below take the following parameter:

`digit`: The digit to write to, from 1 (rightmost on the shield) to 4 (leftmost)

`writeDigit`: Displays a digit. Takes the following parameters:

1. `digit`
2. `value`: The numeric value to show on the digit (0-9)
3. `decimalPoint`: If the digit's decimal point is shown (`true` to show, `false` to hide)

`writeDigitData`: Controls the individual segments on a digit.

1. `digit`
2. `value`: 1-byte integer containing the segments to display

<CollapsiblePane title="Segment Values" client:load>
  Segment values may be added together to display them together:

  ![Segment values](@img/7-segment-shield/segments.svg)
</CollapsiblePane>

### Clearing the Display

`clear`: Turns off all segments on the display. Takes no parameters.

## Displaying Integers

Integers can also be displayed on the shield. An example is at **Display > DisplayNum**.

<CodeFile src="downloads/SevenSegmentShield/examples/Display/DisplayNum/DisplayNum.ino" />

The code above randomly generates integers and displays them with the function below:

`displayInt`: Shows an integer on the entire display.

1. `number`: Number to show (-999 to 9999)

## Cycling Brightness

The brightness of the display can be adjusted by changing the amount of current the LEDs receive. An example is at **Display > CycleBrightness**.

<CodeFile src="downloads/SevenSegmentShield/examples/Display/CycleBrightness/CycleBrightness.ino" />

The code loops through each possible current value, passing each to the function:

`writeBrightness`: Sets the brightness of the seven-segment display. The default current is 12 mA.

1. `brightness`: Current value to determine brightness. Possible values are:

- BRIGHTNESS_3MA (3 mA current)
- BRIGHTNESS_6MA (6 mA current)
- BRIGHTNESS_9MA (9 mA current)
- BRIGHTNESS_12MA (12 mA current)
- BRIGHTNESS_18MA (18 mA current)
- BRIGHTNESS_21MA (21 mA current)

## Using the EEPROM Chip

The 24LC128 chip on the shield can hold 128 kB of data. The **EEPROM > ReadWrite** example demonstrates performing I/O on the addresses of the EEPROM.

### Reading and Writing Memory

The methods below are part of the `MemoryChip` class, which represents the onboard 24LC128. They share the following parameter:

`address`: The address to read or write from

`readByte`: Returns the byte at the specified memory address.

1. `address`

`writeByte`: Writes the given byte to the specified memory address.

1. `address`
2. `data`: Byte to write

<Alert>
  After writing to the EEPROM, insert a short delay (such as 5 ms in the example) to prevent the loss of communication data.
</Alert>

## Controlling the LED

The shield's RGB LED is connected to three PWM pins on the Arduino. The **LED > CycleColors** example uses PWM to display different colors.

<CodeFile src="downloads/SevenSegmentShield/examples/LED/CycleColors/CycleColors.ino" />

### Hex and RGB Colors

The example above defines 48 hex colors. Each color is an integer with 8 bits of red (leftmost bits), green, and blue (rightmost bits) values.

`displayHexColor`: Displays a color on the LED given in hexadecimal format.

1. `hh`: Color

`displayRGBColor`: Displays a color on the LED given with individual red, green, and blue components.

1. `r`: 8-bit red value
2. `g`: 8-bit green value
3. `b`: 8-bit blue value

`turnOff`: Turns the LED off. Takes no parameters.

## Reading from the TMP75

The **TMP75 > Thermometer** example uses the shield to create a thermometer. The temperature is displayed on the segments, and the LED changes color accordingly.

All TMP75 functions are contained inside a class called `TMP75`.

### Initializing the TMP75

`begin`: Initializes the TMP75 and configures it to 12-bit resolution.

### Reading the Temperature

`read`: Returns the temperature read by the TMP75 in degrees Celsius.
